This was the agent repository from IU github, then the D2I svn, and then the HTRC Sourceforge repository.

The SBT project root is the "agent" directory. There are four sub projects. 

The agent directory includes the "rest" and "worker" sub projects. The "rest" project is the code presenting the rest API. It uses the Play2-mini framework to do so, and runs using whatever the default server is. Probably Netty of some sort.

The "worker" sub project is a, currently minimal, worker that can be configured for deployment to a compute node. It can then run computational jobs for the JVM the "rest" project is running on.

The "http" project is in the http directory. This subproject is a bridge between the "Ning async http client" for Java, and Akka. The bridge allows http requests to return Akka futures. It is implemented by registering a write into an Akka promise as the callback for the Ning asynchronous request. Additional functions are included to make it easy to use the bridge. A simple Oauth2 client is also present.

The "client" subproject is implemented using the http bridge and makes it easy to use the agent rest interface. It is used primarily for testing. The primary API test is to start the agent, and then run the test spec in the client. A "gotcha" is that the test will only run correctly on a fresh agent instance. Changing this is on a todo list.
