This is a start on a "spray" version of the HTRC agent. It uses
spray-servlet instead of spray-can so it will deploy to Jetty.

This readme hasn't really been written yet. The joys of rapid
development...

The code in this "initial commit" is the progress I've made so far
while using git. (yes yes...) Finally swapping this code over as I
should have awhile ago.
